# Portfolio_JacobKern

## Description

A portfolio showcasing projects that I have previously worked on, an about and contact section. I made this portfolio to allow employers and others to easily find information and projects I've done all on one page. I used a combination of HTML and CSS to develop it. I quickly learned during the making of this application that mockups and wire framing are very important. I wish I had made a mockup or wireframe prior to making it to better understand what I want my application to look like in the end rather than figuring it out along the way.
